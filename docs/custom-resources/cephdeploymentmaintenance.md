# CephDeploymentMaintenance custom resource

Cluster maintenance is an important part of a cluster lifecycle.
The `CephDeploymentMaintenance` (`cephdeploymentmaintenances.lcm.mirantis.com`) custom resource (CR) allows you to properly handle cluster maintenance and control the states of a Ceph cluster and Pelagia controllers.

To obtain the current maintenance status, run the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n pelagia get cephdeploymentmaintenance -o yaml
```

??? "Example `CephDeploymentMaintenance` resource"

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    items:
    - apiVersion: lcm.mirantis.com/v1alpha1
      kind: CephDeploymentMaintenance
      metadata:

    ```

Out-of-the-box, Pelagia has no maintenance controller that controls the `CephDeploymentMaintenance` object.
Therefore, to control maintenance using Pelagia, you must implement and use an environment-specific maintenance controller.

<a name="cephdeploymentmaintenance-high-level-status-fields"></a>
## High-level status fields

- `state` - Current cluster maintenance state. Possible values are:

    - `Idle` - No maintenance in progress
    - `Acting` - Maintenance is in progress
    - `Failing` - Critical issues occur during maintenance

- `lastStateCheck` - `DateTime` when the previous cluster state check occurred.
- `message` - Additional information about the current maintenance state, if any.

## Maintenance flow overview

Pelagia controllers monitor the `CephDeploymentMaintenance` object state.
When the `CephDeploymentMaintenance` object enters the `Acting` or `Failing` state, Pelagia controllers treat this as the cluster maintenance state and perform the following actions:

- `pelagia-lcm-controller` - scales down the Rook Operator deployment to `0`.
  Once maintenance is completed, the controller scales the Rook Operator deployment back to `1`.
- `pelagia-deployment-controller` - stops `CephDeployment` reconciliation.
  Once maintenance is completed, the controller resumes `CephDeployment` reconciliation.
